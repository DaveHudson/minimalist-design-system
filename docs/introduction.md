This is a central repository for design patterns and guidelines. It was created to help define our visual language, and to aide development of our applications. 

## For Designers
Look into Sketch output of components.

## For Developers
By publishing to npm, this is a living style guide in it's truest form. Changes to your style guide propogate out across all applications as new versions are released. 

This makes maintenance of core components relatively easy, it also means changes must be justified at both a code and design level. 

## Storybook

To aide design and development a set of stories are maintained with Storybook.
